Pop into office hours or DM us in MS Teams if you have a specific question about your work or if you would like another pair of eyes or talk through your code.\n",

For more information, read the following article [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) or ask your TA's for tips.\n",

    "Aircraft collisions with wildlife pose risks to aviation safety, causing damage, operational disruptions, and loss of life. This practicum analyzes the FAA Wildlife Strike Database (1990–2024) to identify trends, key contributing factors, and potential mitigation strategies. By performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistical testing, we aim to determine how factors like time of day, season, altitude, and aircraft type influence strike incidents. Additionally, we will assess trends over time, the impact of environmental changes, and species involvement. Insights from this analysis can help improve aviation safety and wildlife management policies."

    "2. The most popular phase of flight is approach. The approach phase is when the aircraft is about to land at the airport. This makes sense because the aircraft is at lower altitudes where wildlife like birds are. This is also when aircrafts are close to airports, which tends to have more wildlife like birds. \n",
    "3. The most popular airport for wildlife strikes is Denver International Airport. This could be because Denver is one of the busiest airports in the US, so it naturally has more aircrafts. Denver is also located to a lot of wildlife habitats. Deneve"
